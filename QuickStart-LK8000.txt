I. Instalation
--------------
1. Obtain latest Condor2Nav release package from the project website and extract it
   anywhere on the hard drive.
2. Have LK8000 installed and configured on the target device (e.g. PDA, PNA, PC)
3. Copy directory "[CONDOR_2_NAV_PATH]/data/LK8000/_Waypoints" with waypoints for all
   supported Condor landscapes to "LK8000" subdirectory on the target device with
   your LK8000 instalation.
4. If [LK8000] "CheckForMapUpdates=1" Condro2Nav will check on the startup for
   new better maps matching Condor Landscapes. If such maps are available
   they will be downloaded automatically.
5. Copy directory "[CONDOR_2_NAV_PATH]/data/LK8000/_Maps" with all downloaded LK8000
   maps to "LK8000" subdirectory on the target device with your LK8000 instalation.

   device (data will be copied via ActiveSync connection)
