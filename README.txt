1. Description
--------------
Condor2Nav is intended to make Condor (The Competition Soaring Simulator) and
gliding navigation applications synchronization easier. It will be a fully
automated translator between Condor and navigation applications files formats.

The main idea of the application is based on the XCondor application made by
Simon Taylor (thanks Simon for providing me the sources), however Condor2Nav
C++ code is written from the scratch and it has (and will have more) new
features to make the integration more accurate.

At the very beginning it will be a command line based application (no GUI) and
will support XCSoar (www.xcsoar.org) only.
